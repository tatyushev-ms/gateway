# Gateway

This project is part of my demonstration project. Like any other sub-project, it is meant to show my abilities to design and maintain a system, write qualitative code (including tests, of course), learn and use some of the technologies which I use on a daily basis at work and be one more reason to explore the latest changes of used frameworks and libraries.

The role of this sub-project application in the whole project is API gateway.
